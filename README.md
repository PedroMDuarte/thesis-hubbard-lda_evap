## LDA solutions for the Hubbard model in a compenated optical lattice

Here I present code to obtain the LDA profiles of all relevant energyes and
thermodynamic quantities in a compensated optical lattice.   The solution used
for the homogeneous model is the high-temperature series expansion (HTSE) up to
second order in $T/t$.
